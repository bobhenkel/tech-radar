Dapr,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<p>Need to look into. <strong><a href=""https://dapr.io/"">Dapr</a></strong> solves this problem for <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws"">AWS</a> by providing local <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html"">test double</a> implementations of a wide range of AWS services, including S3, Kinesis, DynamoDB and Lambda. It builds on top of best-of-breed tools such as <a href=""https://github.com/mhart/kinesalite"">Kinesalite</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/mhart/dynalite"">dynalite</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/spulec/moto"">Moto</a> and adds isolated processes and error injection functionality. LocalStack is very easy to use, ships with a simple JUnit runner and a JUnit 5 extension and can also run inside a docker container. For many teams, it has become the default for testing services that are deployed on AWS.</p>"
WTF,adopt,tools,TRUE,"<p>Despite the name a handy terminal dashboard.<strong><a href=""https://wtfutil.com//"">Dapr</a></strong>, is rapidly becoming a de facto choice for creating and managing cloud infrastructures by writing declarative definitions. The configuration of the servers instantiated by Terraform is usually left to Puppet, Chef or Ansible. We like Terraform because the syntax of its files is quite readable and because it supports a number of cloud providers while making no attempt to provide an artificial abstraction across those providers. The active community will add support for the latest features from most cloud providers. Following our first, more cautious, mention of Terraform almost two years ago, it has seen continued development and has evolved into a stable product with a good ecosystem that has proven its value in our projects. The issue with state file management can now be sidestepped by using what Terraform calls a ""remote state backend."" We've successfully used <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"">AWS S3</a> for that purpose.</p>"

Pharmer,trial,tools,TRUE,"<p>Kubernetes Cluster Manager using Kubeadm & Cluster API <strong><a href=""https://github.com/pharmer/pharmer"">Pharmer</a></strong></p>"
Helm,trial,tools,TRUE,"<p><a href=""http://helm.sh""><strong>Helm</strong></a> is a package manager for <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. It comes with a repository of curated Kubernetes applications that are maintained in the official <a href=""https://github.com/helm/charts"">Charts repository</a>. Helm has two components: a command line utility called Helm and a cluster component called Tiller. Securing a Kubernetes cluster is a wide and nuanced topic, but we highly recommend setting up Tiller in a role-based access control (RBAC) environment. We've used Helm in a number of client projects and its dependency management, templating and hook mechanism has greatly simplified the application lifecycle management in Kubernetes. However, we recommend proceeding with caution — Helm's <a href=""/radar/techniques/templating-in-yaml"">YAML templating</a> can be difficult to understand, and Tiller still has some rough edges. Helm 3 is expected to address these issues.</p>"
InSpec,trial,tools,TRUE,"<p>How does an organization give autonomy to delivery teams while still making sure their deployed solutions are safe and compliant? How do you ensure that servers, once deployed, maintain a consistent configuration without drift? <strong><a href=""https://www.chef.io/inspec/"">InSpec</a></strong> is positioned as a solution for continuous compliance and security, but you can also use it for general infrastructure testing. InSpec allows the creation of declarative infrastructure tests, which can then be continuously run against provisioned environments including production. Our teams particularly praise its extensible design with resources and matchers for multiple platforms. We recommend trialling InSpec as a solution to the problem of assuring compliance and security.</p>"
Terratest,assess,tools,TRUE,"<p>We widely use <a href=""/radar/tools/terraform"">Terraform</a> as code to configure a cloud infrastructure. <strong><a href=""https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest"">Terratest</a></strong> is a Golang library that makes it easier to write automated tests for infrastructure code. A test run creates real infrastructure components (such as servers, firewalls or load balancers), deploys applications on them and validates the expected behavior using Terratest. At the end of the test, Terratest can undeploy the apps and clean up resources. This makes it largely useful for end-to-end tests of your infrastructure in a real environment.</p>"
Release train,hold,techniques,TRUE,"<p>We've seen organizations successfully move from very infrequent releases to a higher cadence by using the <strong>release train</strong> concept. The release train is a technique for coordinating releases across multiple teams or components that have runtime dependencies. All releases happen on a fixed and reliable schedule regardless of whether all expected features are ready (the train doesn't wait for you — if you miss it you wait for the next one). Although we wholeheartedly endorse discipline around regularly releasing and demoing working software, we've experienced serious drawbacks with the approach over the medium to long term as it reinforces temporal coupling around sequencing of changes and can degrade quality as teams rush to complete features. We prefer to focus on the architectural and organizational approaches necessary to support independent releases. Although the train can be a useful forcing function for speeding up slower teams, we've also seen it as imposing an upper limit on how quickly faster-moving teams can move. We believe that it is a technique that should be approached with a good degree of caution, if at all.</p>"
